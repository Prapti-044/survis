        "abstract": "In the promising era of Handwritten Numeral Recognition (HNR), despite Bangla being one of the major languages in the Indian subcontinent, fewer explorations have been done on Bangla numerals compared to other languages. Among the existing methods, several convolutional neural network (CNN) based method outperformed other methods. But CNN always gets confused with some specific Bangla numerals due to the similarity of shape and size of different numerals. The main purpose of this study is to expand Bangla HNR by considering a novel methodology with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. In the proposed method, images are thinned and a sequence is extracted. These extracted sequences are used to classify using LSTM network. Both single-layer LSTM and Deep LSTM models are trained and performance tested on a benchmark dataset with a large number of samples. On the other hand, traditional CNN is also trained for better understanding. Experimental outcomes revealed that the proposed LSTM based method outperformed CNN with remarkable accuracy for the similar shaped numerals. Finally, the proposed method achieved a test set recognition rate of 98.03\\% which is better than or competitive to other prominent existing methods.",

        "abstract": "Handwritten numerals of different languages have various characteristics. Similarities and dissimilarities of the languages can be measured by analyzing the extracted features of the numerals. Handwritten numeral datasets are available and accessible for many renowned languages of different regions. In this paper, several handwritten numeral datasets of different languages are collected. Then they are used to find the similarity among those written languages through determining and comparing the similitude of each handwritten numerals. This will help to find which languages have the same or adjacent parent language. Firstly, a similarity measure of two numeral images is constructed with a Siamese network. Secondly, the similarity of the numeral datasets is determined with the help of the Siamese network and a new random sample with replacement similarity averaging technique. Finally, an agglomerative clustering is done based on the similarities of each dataset. This clustering technique shows some very interesting properties of the datasets. The property focused in this paper is the regional resemblance of the datasets. By analyzing the clusters, it becomes easy to identify which languages are originated from similar regions.",

        "abstract": "Signal processing is a vast subfield of electrical and computer science where audio signal processing has secured a remarkable position to restore corrupted or missing audio blocks. However, generating possible future audio block from the previous audio block is still a new idea that can help to reduce both audio noise and partially missing an audio segment. In this paper, a generative adversarial network (GAN) along with a pipeline is proposed for the prediction of possible audio after an input audio sequence. The proposed model uses short-time Fourier transformation of audio to make it an image. The image is then fed to a conditional GAN to predict the output image. After that, Inverse short-time Fourier transform is then applied to that predicted image, generating the predicted audio sequence. For a small audio sequence prediction, the proposed methodology is quite fast, robust and has achieved a loss of 0.43. So it is may work well if deployed on a voice call and broadcasting applications.",

        "abstract": "Convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods have been very successful for handwritten numeral recognition (HNR) applications. However, CNN seems to misclassify similar shaped numerals (i.e., the silhouette of the numerals that look same). This paper presents an enhanced HNR system to improve the classification accuracy of the similar shaped hand written numerals incorporating the terminals points with CNN\u2019s recognition. In hand written numerals, the terminal points (i.e. the start and end positions) are considered as additional property to discriminate between similar shaped numerals. Start-End Writing Measure (SEWM) and its integration with CNN is the main contribution of this research. There are three major functional steps in the proposed SEWM-CNN: classification of a numeral image using a standard CNN; identification of start and end writing points from the silhouette of the numerals; and finally, system output integrating SEWM with the CNN decision. The proposed method is tested on rich benchmark numeral datasets of Bengali and Devanagari numerals. SEWM-CNN reveals itself as a suitable HNR method for Bengali and Devanagari numerals while compared with other existing methods.",

        "abstract": "History clearly shows from the former times to recent times that the development of a region is heavily contingent on the transport network. Nowadays, however, there are a number of network transport problems, including increased operational costs for vehicles, delay, road congestion, pollution, and road accidents, which are becoming the major issues in a developing country like Bangladesh. Digitized analysis and strategy formulation on constructing, maintaining and upgrading are crucial to get the greatest available solution for these problems. This research contributes towards this analysis by creation, evaluation and compilation maps from obtained information. The present study made an effort to prepare road networks and application of several Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques on the pedestrian, rickshaw, metro and public transit transports systems and receive the optimum transport solution on a variety of cost metrics like traversing distance, velocity and time. Another important discovery made in this research is the relationship between regional road density to cost and travel time. This article demonstrated that in Dhaka city area, based on efficient shortest path algorithm design and a graph generated with 49869 nodes and 53878 edges, the shortest distance between two points may not always be cost-effective and conversely.",

        "abstract": "Vision is one of the basic human senses and is signif- icant for visual sensation over surrounding environment. Many proposals have been put forward to provide good support for visual impairment. In this paper, a proposition has been made to help the blind victims gather knowledge about their nearby areas.  The scenery of the image is captured and then preprocessed.  Image feature extraction is done through object detection and facial recognition. Then a textual description is generated with two different techniques, Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) and template-based, which will illustrate the scenario in-front. On the basis of the interpretative text, an audio is generated through the rearrangement of the previously recorded voice segments. The proposed approach was implemented and tested on 10 pseudo blind people walking in about 15 different surroundings.",
